# TalentTrust Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for the TalentTrust freelancer escrow protocol on Stellar.

## Repository Scope

- **Escrow contract** (`contracts/escrow`): Holds funds in escrow, supports milestone-based payments and reputation credential issuance. **Token custody is on-chain** via a Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) bound at admin setup; `deposit_funds` and `release_milestone` perform real `token::Client::transfer` calls.
- **Planned escrow fee model**: Configurable protocol fee is now wired into `release_milestone` (`set_protocol_fee_bps`); fee retention into `AccumulatedProtocolFees` is implemented. A separate `withdraw_protocol_fees` entrypoint remains tracked in [#314](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/314).

Reviewer-oriented notes live in [docs/escrow/README.md](docs/escrow/README.md), with storage-key details in [docs/escrow/state-persistence.md](docs/escrow/state-persistence.md), threat analysis in [docs/escrow/SECURITY.md](docs/escrow/SECURITY.md), and release authorization modes in [docs/escrow/authorization.md](docs/escrow/authorization.md).

## Security Model

The escrow implementation follows a fail-closed state machine:

- contract creation requires client authorization and rejects invalid participant or milestone metadata before persisting state
- a Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) settlement token is admin-bound exactly once via `bind_settlement_token`; each subsequent `deposit_funds` and `release_milestone` calls `token::Client::transfer` and updates accounting atomically
- deposits pull SAC tokens from the client BEFORE `funded_amount` is updated, so a failed transfer leaves accounting untouched
- deposits cannot exceed the required escrow total
- releases pay the freelancer (less protocol fee) via SAC transfer BEFORE milestone state is updated, so a failed payout leaves state untouched
- releases require a valid unreleased milestone, caller authorization via `caller.require_auth()`, and valid non-expired approvals matching the contract's `ReleaseAuthorization` mode
- reputation is gated behind contract completion and is issued once per contract
- finalization records immutable close metadata for completed or disputed contracts and blocks later contract-specific mutations
- one-time admin initialization protects pause and emergency controls; two-step admin transfer is planned in [#318](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/318)
- pause and emergency controls block all state-changing escrow operations while active

Planned governance-transfer and migration features are explicitly labeled in the escrow docs until their entrypoints land.

```bash
# Run tests (includes 95%+ coverage negative path testing for escrow)
cargo test

# Run escrow performance/gas baseline tests only
cargo test test::performance

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Run escrow-specific tests
cargo test -p escrow

# Run escrow performance tests only
cargo test test::performance -p escrow
```

## Escrow Emergency Controls

The escrow contract supports critical-incident response with admin-managed controls:

- `initialize(admin)` _(one-time setup)_
- `pause()` and `unpause()`
- `activate_emergency_pause()` and `resolve_emergency()`
- `is_paused()` and `is_emergency()`

When paused, all mutating escrow operations (`create_contract`, `deposit_funds`, `release_milestone`, `issue_reputation`, `cancel_contract`) are blocked with `ContractPaused`.

Read-only queries are never blocked.

See `docs/escrow/emergency-controls.md` for the full flag semantics, event model, and security properties.

---

## Escrow Closure Finalization

`finalize_contract(contract_id, finalizer)` records immutable close metadata for contracts in `Completed` or `Disputed` status.

The finalizer must be the stored client, freelancer, or assigned arbiter and must authorize the call.

After finalization, subsequent contract-specific mutating calls fail with `AlreadyFinalized`.

---

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+
- rustfmt
- Stellar CLI _(optional for deployment workflows)_

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make changes while keeping tests, linting, and formatting checks passing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all

cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

cargo test

cargo build
```

3. Open a pull request.

CI runs verification checks automatically.

---

## CI/CD

On every push and pull request to `main`, GitHub Actions:

- Checks formatting:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

- Lints with warnings denied:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

- Builds the workspace:

```bash
cargo build
```

- Runs tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Ensure these pass locally before pushing.
