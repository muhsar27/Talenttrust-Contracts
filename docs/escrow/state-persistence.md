# Storage Layout Reference — TalentTrust Escrow Contract

This document maps the currently implemented `DataKey` storage used by
`contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`. A fuller key-by-key reference, including
declared-but-unused keys, is tracked in
[#342](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/342).

## Live Storage Keys

These participant indexes are **append-only**: every `create_contract` appends the new id to the appropriate index vectors.
The contract list readers (`list_contracts_by_participant`) are therefore consistent with contract creation order.



| Key | Value | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Initialized` | `bool` | `initialize` |
| `Admin` | `Address` | `initialize` |
| `Paused` | `bool` | `pause`, `unpause`, emergency controls |
| `Emergency` | `bool` | emergency controls |
| `Contract(id)` | `EscrowContractData` | create/deposit/release/reputation/cancel |
| `(Contract(id), "milestones")` | `Vec<Milestone>` | create/deposit/release/refund |
| `NextContractId` | `u32` | `create_contract` |
| `ReputationIssued(id)` | `bool` | `issue_reputation` |
| `PendingReputationCredits(address)` | `u32` | final release, `issue_reputation` |
| `Reputation(address)` | `ReputationRecord` | `issue_reputation` |
| `Finalization(id)` | `FinalizationRecord` | `finalize_contract` |
| `ReadinessChecklist` | `ReadinessChecklist` | initialize and emergency controls |
| `ClientContracts(address)` | `Vec<u32>` | create_contract |
| `FreelancerContracts(address)` | `Vec<u32>` | create_contract |

## Declared But Not Live

These keys are declared in `types.rs` but no public entrypoint currently uses
them as a complete feature:

- `MilestoneApprovals`
- `PendingClientMigration`
- `ProtocolFeeBps`
- `AccumulatedProtocolFees`

Protocol fee implementation is tracked in
[#313](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/313) and
[#314](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/314).

## Milestone Released State — Single Source of Truth

`release_milestone` sets `milestone.released = true` inside the persisted
`Vec<Milestone>` stored under `(DataKey::Contract(id), milestone_symbol)` where `milestone_symbol` is derived via the centralized `crate::milestone_symbol` helper returning `symbol_short!("milestone")`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Migration Note:** The storage key symbol for milestones was shortened from `"milestones"` to `"milestone"` to allow optimization using compile-time `symbol_short!("milestone")` constants, reducing runtime host-call overhead. Consequently, any milestones persisted under the old `"milestones"` key in older contract versions will not be readable in this version without a storage migration.

`summarize_contract` (called by `finalize_contract`) derives
`released_milestone_count` by iterating that same vector and counting
`ms.released == true`. There is **no** separate `DataKey::MilestoneReleased`
key — that variant was removed in fix [#416] because it was never written,
causing `released_milestone_count` to always report zero in finalization
summaries.

Read and write path are now identical: the milestone vector is the sole
authority for released state.

### 3. Reputation Auditing States
* **`PendingReputation(Address)` / `ReputationIssued(u32)`**
    * **Description:** Bookkeeping indices capturing un-issued tokens and completion certificates for network participants.
    * **Storage Lifespan:** `Persistent`. Preserved explicitly to guarantee deterministic chronological processing when users harvest pending system values.

- Contract ids are monotonically assigned from `NextContractId`.
- Milestone amounts and participant addresses are immutable after creation.
- `funded_amount`, `released_amount`, and `refunded_amount` are checked after
  balance-changing operations.
- `deposit_funds` preserves the aggregate `Contract(id).funded_amount` while
  also allocating each accepted deposit across `(Contract(id), "milestones")`
  in milestone order. A milestone's `funded_amount` is capped at its immutable
  `amount` before funding moves to the next milestone.
- Deposits that would move aggregate funding above the milestone total are
  rejected before any per-milestone allocation is persisted.
- `release_milestone` requires both aggregate availability and the target
  milestone's own `funded_amount >= amount`, so legacy aggregate-only funding
  cannot release an underallocated milestone.
- A milestone release flag can move from absent/false to true only once.
- Reputation issuance is guarded by `ReputationIssued(contract_id)`.

## Read-Only Views and TTL Extensions

### `get_contract_summary(contract_id)`
The `get_contract_summary` entrypoint compiles a read-only `ContractSummary` struct of a contract's metadata and its milestones for off-chain consumers (front-ends and indexers).

To prevent active contract details from expiring and getting archived by the network, querying `get_contract_summary` automatically extends the persistent storage TTL for:
- The contract record (`DataKey::Contract(contract_id)`)
- The milestones vector (`(DataKey::Contract(contract_id), "milestones")`)

This allows off-chain services or users to keep contract storage alive through reads without requiring caller authentication or mutating transaction fees.
